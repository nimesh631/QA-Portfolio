# Beginner Practice – QA Portfolio

This repository contains QA test cases and API testing samples
created during my learning phase, prior to my internship,
to practice core QA concepts such as SQL validation,
API testing, and test case design.

## About the Beginner Practice Folder
The purpose of this folder is to demonstrate my
foundational understanding of QA processes and tools.
It represents my early-stage learning work and
complements the real-world testing experience
I gained during my internship.
